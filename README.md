# GetSafariPasswords
Steps:
		Open the script with Script Editor
		Launch Safari
		Open Safari's preferences and navigate to the Passwords tab
		Unlock the dialog so your list of credentials is visible
		Switch back to Script Editor and hit its Run button
If all is successful, it will cycle through your rows of login credentials, and export them to a file on your Desktop named pm_export.csv.
